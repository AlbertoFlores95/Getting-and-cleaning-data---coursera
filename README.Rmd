## Instructions

##### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##### 2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
##### 3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##### 4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
##### 5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
source('run_analysis.R')
```

Find the final.txt result in your workinf directory with the output of step 5
